    <h4>Ingridients: </h4>
    <ul>
    1 pound sweet Italian sausage<br>
    ¾ pound lean ground beef<br>
    ½ cup minced onion<br>
    2 cloves garlic, crushed<br>
    1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes<br>
    2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce<br>
    2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste<br>
    ½ cup water<br>
    2 tablespoons white sugar<br>
    4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided<br>
    1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves<br>
    1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste<br>
    1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br>
    ½ teaspoon fennel seeds<br>
    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
    12 lasagna noodles<br>
    16 ounces ricotta cheese<br>
    1 egg<br>
    ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced<br>
    ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Directions: </h4>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
